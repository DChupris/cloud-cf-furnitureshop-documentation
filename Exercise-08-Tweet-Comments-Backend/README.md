# Exercise 6 - Tweet Comments Backend

Mary who is a loyal customer of home furniture franchise has access to the customer portal to provide ratings and comments on the wishlist which Franck has uploaded. Based on the feedback from customers Franck would add highly rated items into his furniture store.

The user interface to provide ratings and comments was completed in Exercise 5 and the backend (Node.js module) to store ratings and comments was completed in Exercise 4.

Once the comments are published on to RabbitMQ by Excercise 4, in this module we pick the same message from the queue and publish it to Twitter.

## 1. Developer Guide

1. Source code for this Nodejs module was cloned as has part of Exercise 4.
    * Click the development icon on the navigation view, the cloned application is displayed; expand the application.

2. Our focus for this exercise is tweet_comments module and enhance it further.

    * For a Node.js application `package.json` file is the core and it lists all the packages that your module depends on. For every application there is launch file which gets executed when the program is deployed.

        This launch file is specified in `script` property under a start tag; in our case it is `app.js`.

    * Uncomment the code in `app.js`, notice the connection to RabbitMQ instance, creation of channel and consume the incoming messages from the queue are achieved this block of code.

        Once the message is received the same is posted on to Twitter.

    * The keys to configure Twitter account is saved in `config.js` under the `config` folder.
